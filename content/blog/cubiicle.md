Several years ago I made a few songs collaboratively with an individual who at the time went by the alias "Cubiicle", and who has since largely vanished from the internet. They also went by "Teramiiko" and "Tagwail" at some point. I just wanted to collect some of the information about the work we did together, since I will likely be remastering/reimagining those songs, and I have no way to properly credit them for their artistic talent.

# Platinum

On 2014-05-28, I released [*Platinum*](https://soundcloud.com/cubician/platinum) on Soundcloud under the alias Cubician (yeah lol, "Cubician" and "Cubiicle", ha ha, get it out of your system). Based off private Soundcloud messages, it appears that we conducted this collaboration primarily over email; unfortunately, I don't have those emails anymore.

# Reborn

Some time in early 2015, Cubiicle released *Reborn* on Soundcloud. On On 2015-05-23, It earned a place in the Best of LMMS Vol. 2 contest, which is available on [Bandcamp](https://lmms.bandcamp.com/track/reborn). At the time, I was using the alias "Whispir", which is now in use by someone else (and, like, some corporation as well, lol). Since Cubiicle deleted their Soundcloud account, Best of LMMS Vol. 2 is the only place where this song still lives.

I hope you're doing well, friend.
