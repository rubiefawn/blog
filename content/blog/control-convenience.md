## Case 1: Spotify

In 2018, I subscribed to Spotify's family plan, providing premium access to myself and my immediate family for about $15 per month. I had already been subscribed to the student plan since 2016 and was pleased with my experience so far. Once I realized that the members of my family were independently subscribed to their own personal plans, I consolidated that cost into one place by paying for the family plan.

At the time, this seemed like excellent value. For the most part, Spotify just worked. I had curated tens of carefully organized playlists for use during TTRPG sessions, plus many more playlists for my own leisure listening. The home page displayed my recent playlists, new releases from artists I followed, my discover weekly, and a few suggested playlists based off my recent listens. It was straightforward and did what I wanted.

Spotify pushed an update (in 2019, I think?) that changed the home page, making it much more centered around Spotify's suggestions. The update also removed the page reserved for playlists. The update generally made it harder to listen to what I wanted to listen to, and much easier to listen to what Spotify wanted me to listen to. At the time, this didn't bother me, but it did bother my Dad so much that he cancelled his Spotify outright. This seemed like an overreaction to me.

Spotify has had several updates since that further scramble the user interface in confounding ways and make it more difficult to find what I am looking for. Not only do I feel like I have less control over what I listen to, the experience of music discovery is worse as well; most of the suggestions are things I already have saved to a playlist, or something completely unrelated to my tastes. Spotify isn't fun to use anymore.

I have mostly solved this by listening to music on an old iPod classic and collecting physical CDs instead. It plays what music I want, when I want it, and as a bonus it doesn't require internet to use. Additionally, I don't have to worry about it draining my phone battery or having wireless earbuds run out of charge. If I want to discover new music, I ask my friends for recommendations or browse local music stores for used CDs.

Is it convenient? Absolutely not! Getting new music requires spending 15 minutes ripping a CD, converting the files to a format the iPod understands, applying missing metadata, and then another 15 minutes syncing the iPod. Getting new music on Spotify happens as quickly as you can type in the name of the album. But it's worth it, because of the sense of ownership and control. My iPod will never receive an update I don't like. My iPod will never advertise to me. My iPod only has music on it that I care about. I value the control of the iPod more than I value the convenience of Spotify.
