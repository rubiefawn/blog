This short album is entirely old music that I have taken time to polish up. Here's some trivia about the songs:

## [Liquid Starlight](https://iansannar.bandcamp.com/track/liquid-starlight)

*Liquid Starlight* was originally uploaded to my old Soundcloud on 2014-03-01 (over a decade ago!). I originally created all the synthesizer sounds using ZynAddSubFX in LMMS, with liberal use of a specific parameter that allowed for randomization of different wave harmonics per-note. This helped each note sound slightly different, which helped the synth sound like water droplets. For the remake, I opted for a more tight and consistent sound.

If you dare, you can listen to an archive of that [old version](https://on.soundcloud.com/CTeewPBPhQWm2hV39) on Soundcloud.

## [Cured More than The Malady](https://iansannar.bandcamp.com/track/cured-more-than-the-malady)

This song was originally released on YouTube on 2017-08-29. At the time, I was deeply unhappy with myself, and thought I could erase my flaws through religion. When I wrote this song, I had yet to realize that drowning myself in piety was not a healthy or long-term solution, but na√Øvely thought that my damaged self-image was a necessary evil in the process of spiritual purification or whatever. I thought I had simply "cured more than the malady". I have since learned that miracles are no replacement for hard work or self-love. Go to therapy!

The [original YouTube upload](https://youtu.be/MUi-GRBpsGw) is available, but unlisted.

## [What If](https://iansannar.bandcamp.com/track/what-if)

The story behind this song is unfathomably cringe. When I was in high school, I had made friends with this girl, and we would eat lunch together and send each other tumblr posts. I was infatuated with what I now recognize was just gender envy (I wanted to look like her), but since I didn't have the vocabulary for that at the time, I assumed my obsession was romantic attraction. I never did talk to her about any of this, and instead opted to just write this song and post it on my tumblr with no explanation.

The original tumblr post was posted sometime around 2016-11. No, it does not exist anymore, and no, you cannot see it, lol.

## [Serenity (Max's Version)](https://iansannar.bandcamp.com/track/serenity-maxs-version)

The original version of *Serenity* was a much more energetic EDM-style track. I had written it for my romantic partner at the time, who went by a different name back then. They have changed a lot since I originally wrote *Serenity*, and so I changed their song too. Max's Version is much gentler than the first arrangement.

I do also plan on releasing a new take on the original EDM-style track, but that one isn't quite ready yet. Perhaps it will be in Cubician III?

*Serenity* was originally uploaded to my old Soundcloud on 2015-03-18 according to Soundcloud, but I believe that is likely the date of a re-upload (something to do with [Best of LMMS Vol. 2](https://lmms.bandcamp.com/track/serenity-remastered) maybe?). You can listen to an archive of that [old version](https://on.soundcloud.com/U6YLGZSmktbyRMcMA) on Soundcloud.

## [Frostbite](https://iansannar.bandcamp.com/track/frostbite)

I honestly don't remember what I was thinking when I made this one. I did end up using it as the music for a weird Youtube video, [Frostbite](https://youtu.be/uQcg-jZLqgg), several years later.

This song was originally known as *Never To Be Found*, and posted on y Soundcloud on 2014-03-07. You can listen to an archive of that [old version](https://on.soundcloud.com/YCSc7UEZoRh1zUAPA) on Soundcloud.

## [End Screen](https://iansannar.bandcamp.com/track/end-screen)

This one has never actually been officially released on any platforms. I made it specifically for the last 20-ish seconds of some Youtube tutorials I was making at the time. This is the first time it's been made available outside those videos.

Since I've never released the old version outside those Youtube videos, you'll never know what it sounded like unless you know where to find those. Good luck!
