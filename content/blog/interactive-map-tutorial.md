For a few years I've tinkered with interactive maps as a worldbuilding tool and a resource for my players when facilitating table-top roleplaying games.

- Red Giant maps or whatever his handle was
- Generating map data instead of hand-drawn
- MapLibre instead of Mapbox
- Globe projection

There was a season in which I offered this as a service through Fiverr. While I am not currently active on Fiverr, you can still commission me to create a map for you by emailing me at rubiefawn@gmail.com.

- Next steps: Generate geojson shapes from plate tectonics simulation? Custom raster DEM elevation data?
