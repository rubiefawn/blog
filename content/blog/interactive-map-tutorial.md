For a few years I've tinkered with interactive maps as a worldbuilding tool and a resource for my players when facilitating table-top roleplaying games.

- [Red Giant Maps](https://redgiantmaps.com) and his [very helpful tutorial](https://youtu.be/5ByYLeTls2Q)
- Generating map data instead of hand-drawn
- [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) instead of Mapbox
- Globe projection
- Tile data offline using [`felt/tippecanoe`](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe)
- Render sprite sheets using [`OpenDataLand/maplibre-gl-svg-sprite`](https://github.com/OpenDataLand/maplibre-gl-svg-sprite)

There was a season in which I offered this as a service through Fiverr. While I am not currently active on Fiverr, you can still commission me to create a map for you by emailing me at `rubiefawn@gmail.com`.

- Next steps: Generate geojson shapes from plate tectonics simulation? Custom raster DEM elevation data?
