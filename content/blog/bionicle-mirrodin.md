Bionicle was a line of buildable action figures produced by Lego from 2001 until 2010. It was pretty straightforward: six heroes, commanding the power of the elements, must defeat the bad guy in order to save their god, Mata Nui, from an endless slumber. A pretty standard story for toys aimed at children. Except, it wasn't straightforwardâ€”how did god fall asleep? Why are all the characters half-robot? Why do the robots have a god in the first place? And it only got weirder from there.

It turns out, all the characters are drones whose original purpose was to perform maintenance on their god, Mata Nui, who happens to be a forty million foot tall robot, which was in turn created to travel the stars and learn how to revive its home planet, which was rendered a barren wasteland after its inhabitants completely exploited its natural resources. None of the inhabitants of Mata Nui were even supposed to have free will, but one of the creators of the robot [thought it would be funny](https://biosector01.com/wiki/The_Awakening) and, you know, thrust sapience upon billions. Given free will, one of the inhabitants of the robot, Makuta, crashes the entire goddamn thing with a computer virus in a (successful) attempt to take over their entire known universe, which is why god is asleep. None of the inhabitants of the Mata Nui robot know any of this until they successfully wake the robot up, only to find that Makuta controls the entire thing now. No big deal, right?

Over the course of Bionicle's story, the robot drones have hundreds of thousands of years to come to terms with sapience, and, well, become human. They create art. They go to war. They practice religion. They develop several distinct cultures. The revelation that god has been overthrown completely destroys their understanding of the world. These biomechanical drones have a faith crisis.

So, god is real, god is a robot, you live inside god, and also god has been replaced by an evil doppelganger. What do you do in this situation?

In the lore of the Magic the Gathering trading card game, there exists a special kind of mage called a "planeswalker", who has the ability to travel between worlds. One of those planeswalkers is an incredibly traumatized robot named Karn, who created a new world called ["Argentum"](https://mtg.wiki/page/New_Phyrexia_(plane)#History) as a space for him to chill out. Initially, Argentum was just a bunch of metal floor tiles and a robotic steward called Memnarch, but Karn accidentally tracked in some evil mud on his shoes known as "Phyrexian Oil", which ends up driving Memnarch mad. Memnarch begins abducting creatures from all over the universe in order to populate Argentum, just for fun. The inhabitants of this world become biomechanical, just like their environment. They develop distinct cultures, and rename the planet to "Mirrodin". One of them kills Memnarch after he creates ane evil doomsday machine to harvest all of them to give himself planeswalker powers. Oops!

Turns out the Phyrexian Oil is super contagious, like a fantasy version of the Borg. The Oil begins corrupting the entire planet and its inhabitants. The corrupted create a religion, rename the planet "New Phyrexia" (Karn helped blow up the old one), and declare war on all non-Phyrexians. Five distinct sects of the Phyrexian religion emerge. Eventually, Karn returns to Argentum to take a break, only to find that the entire thing is populated and at war. Totally unprepared for this chaos, the Phyrexians strap him to a chair, corrupt/kill him, and declare him their new machine-god.

So, god is real, god is a robot, god never intended for you to exist in his world, and also god is dead now. What do you do in this situation?
