Just a silly gal doing silly things. I like music and telling stories, both of which are better with friends~ 💞

- 🎲 [Remedy](https://remedy.neonfable.com): A tabletop roleplaying game, part of the [New School Revolution](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/).
- 📻 [UNWISH](https://www.youtube.com/@UNWISH): I write tunes occasionally; [see what's cooking! 🤫](https://sketches.frogify.net)
- 🗺️ [Interactive maps](https://map.neonfable.com): Like Google Earth, but for fantasy settings instead.
  - These are a bit neglected at the moment, but now that MapLibre has support for [globe projection](https://maplibre.org/roadmap/globe-view/), I can make the full switch from Mapbox.
- 🎧 [LMMS](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms): I enjoy contributing to this open-source digital audio workstation.
